For any finite F ⊆ S, we construct a comprehensive Gröbner basis of the ideal Id(F), i.e. a finite ideal basis of Id(F) that is a Gröbner basis of Id(F) in K′[X1, …, Xn] for every specialization of the parameters U1, …, Um in an arbitrary field K1. We show that this construction can be performed with the same worst case degree bounds in the main variables Xi, as for ordinary Gröbner bases; moreover, examples computed in an ALDES/SAC-2 implementation show that the construction is of practical value. Comprehensive Gröbner bases admit numerous applications to parametric problems in algebraic geometry; in particular, they yield a fast elimination of quantifier-blocks in algebraically closed fields.}

This class of solvable polynomial rings includes many rings arising naturally in mathematics and physics, such as iterated Ore extensions of fields and enveloping algebras of finite dimensional Lie algebras. We present algorithms that compute Grobner bases of one- and two-sided ideals in solvable polynomial rings. They extend Buchberger's algorithm (see Buchberger, 1985) in the commutative case and Apel and Lassner's algorithms (see Apel &amp; Lassner, 1988) for one-sided ideals in enveloping algebras of Lie algebras, as well as the results on one-sided standard bases in Weyl algebras, sketched in Galligo (1985). We show that reduced one- and two-sided Grobner bases in solvable polynomial rings are unique, and we solve the word problem and the ideal membership problem for algebras of solvable type, in particular in Clifford algebras. Further applications include the computation of elimination ideals, computing in residue modules and the computation of generators for modules of syzygies.},

  abstract = {Given symmetric matrices A0,A1,…,An of size m with rational entries, the set of real vectors x=(x1,…,xn) such that the matrix A0+x1A1+⋯+xnAn has non-negative eigenvalues is called a spectrahedron. Minimization of linear functions over spectrahedra is called semidefinite programming. Such problems appear frequently in control theory and real algebra, especially in the context of nonnegativity certificates for multivariate polynomials based on sums of squares. Numerical software for semidefinite programming are mostly based on interior point methods, assuming non-degeneracy properties such as the existence of an interior point in the spectrahedron. In this paper, we design an exact algorithm based on symbolic homotopy for solving semidefinite programs without assumptions on the feasible set, and we analyze its complexity. Because of the exactness of the output, it cannot compete with numerical routines in practice. However, we prove that solving such problems can be done in polynomial time if either n or m is fixed.}

Said algorithms are currently the best known algorithms for computing Gröbner bases in terms of computational efficiency. The formal development attempts to be as generic as possible, generalizing most known variants of signature-based algorithms, but at the same time the implemented functions are effectively executable on concrete input for efficiently computing mechanically verified Gröbner bases. Besides correctness the formalization also proves that under certain conditions the algorithms a-priori detect and avoid all useless reductions to zero, and return minimal signature Gröbner bases. To the best of our knowledge, the formalization presented here is the only formalization of signature-based Gröbner basis algorithms in existence so far.}

The minimal complete set of matchers for such a system can be infinite, but our algorithm computes its finite representation in the form of solved set. From the practical side, we identify two finitary cases and impose restrictions on the procedure to get an incomplete algorithm, which, based on our experiments, describes the input-output behavior and properties of Mathematica's flat and orderless pattern matching.}

In this paper, we formulate Vizing's conjecture as a Positivstellensatz existence question. In particular, we select classes of graphs according to their number of vertices and their domination number and encode the conjecture as an ideal/polynomial pair such that the polynomial is non-negative on the variety associated with the ideal if and only if the conjecture is true for this graph class. Using semidefinite programming we obtain numeric sum-of-squares certificates, which we then manage to transform into symbolic certificates confirming non-negativity of our polynomials. Specifically, we obtain exact low-degree sparse sum-of-squares certificates for particular classes of graphs. The obtained certificates allow generalizations for larger graph classes. Besides computational verification of these more general certificates, we also present theoretical proofs as well as conjectures and questions for further investigations.}

  abstract = {As a fundamental notion, the free differential algebra on a set is concretely constructed as the polynomial algebra on the differential variables. Such a construction is not known for the more general notion of the free differential algebra on an algebra, from the left adjoint functor of the forgetful functor from differential algebras to algebras, instead of sets. In this paper we show that a generator-relation presentation of a base algebra can be extended to the free differential algebra on this base algebra. More precisely, a Gröbner-Shirshov basis property of the base algebra can be extended to the free differential algebra on this base algebra, allowing a Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt type basis for these more general free differential algebras. Examples are provided as illustrations.}

In this paper, we show that the sparse difference resultant of a generic Laurent transformally essential system can be computed via the sparse resultant of a simple algebraic system arising from the difference system. Moreover, new order bounds of sparse difference resultant are found. Then we propose an efficient algorithm to compute sparse difference resultant which is the quotient of two determinants whose elements are the coefficients of the polynomials in the algebraic system. The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and experimental results show the efficiency of the algorithm.}

We provide a hybrid numeric-symbolic algorithm computing exact rational SOS decompositions with rational coefficients for polynomials lying in the interior of the SOS cone. The first step of this algorithm computes an approximate SOS decomposition for a perturbation of the input polynomial with an arbitrary-precision SDP solver. Next, an exact SOS decomposition is obtained thanks to the perturbation terms and a compensation phenomenon. We prove that bit complexity estimates on output size and runtime are both polynomial in the degree of the input polynomial and singly exponential in the number of variables. Next, we apply this algorithm to compute exact Reznick, Hilbert-Artin's representation and Putinar's representations respectively for positive definite forms and positive polynomials over basic compact semi-algebraic sets. We also report on practical experiments done with the implementation of these algorithms and existing alternatives such as the critical point method and cylindrical algebraic decomposition.}

We present a new approach using Proof Tree Preserving Interpolation and an array solver based on Weak Equivalence on Arrays. We give an interpolation algorithm for the lemmas produced by the array solver. The computed interpolants have worst-case exponential size for extensionality lemmas and worst-case quadratic size otherwise. We show that these bounds are strict in the sense that there are lemmas with no smaller interpolants. We implemented the algorithm and show that the produced interpolants are useful to prove memory safety for C programs.",

  abstract="Quantifier elimination for the elementary formal theory of real numbers is a fascinating area of research at the intersection of various field of mathematics and computer science, such as mathematical logic, commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, computer algebra, computational geometry and complexity theory. Originally the method of quantifier elimination was invented (among others by Th. Skolem) in mathematical logic as a technical tool for solving the decision problem for a formalized mathematical theory. For the elementary formal theory of real numbers (or more accurately of real closed fields) such a quantifier elimination procedure was established in the 1930s by A. Tarski, using an extension of Sturm's theorem of the 1830s for counting the number of real zeros of a univariate polynomial in a given interval. Since then an abundance of new decision and quantifier elimination methods for this theory with variations and optimizations has been published with the aim both of establishing the theoretical complexity of the problem and of finding methods that are of practical importance (see Arnon 1988a and the discussion and references in Renegar 1992a, 1992b, 1992c for a comparison of these methods). For sub-problems such as elimination of quantifiers with respect to variables, that are linearly or quadratically restricted, specialized methods have been developed with good success (see Weispfenning 1988; Loos and Weispfenning 1993; Hong 1992d; Weispfenning 1997).",

Such a representation is a certificate for the nonnegativity of f on S. We give a bound on the degrees of the terms @s"ig"i in this representation which depends on the description of S, the degree of f and a measure of how close f is to having a zero on S.

  abstract = {This book provides a self-contained, accessible introduction to the mathematical advances and challenges resulting from the use of semidefinite programming in polynomial optimization. This quickly evolving research area with contributions from the diverse fields of convex geometry, algebraic geometry, and optimization is known as convex algebraic geometry. Each chapter addresses a fundamental aspect of convex algebraic geometry. The book begins with an introduction to nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares and their connections to semidefinite programming and quickly advances to several areas at the forefront of current research. These include semidefinite representability of convex sets, duality theory from the point of view of algebraic geometry, and nontraditional topics such as sums of squares of complex forms and noncommutative sums of squares polynomials. Suitable for a class or seminar, with exercises aimed at teaching the topics to beginners, Semidefinite Optimization and Convex Algebraic Geometry serves as a point of entry into the subject for readers from multiple communities such as engineering, mathematics, and computer science. A guide to the necessary background material is available in the appendix. Audience This book can serve as a textbook for graduate-level courses presenting the basic mathematics behind convex algebraic geometry and semidefinite optimization. Readers conducting research in these areas will discover open problems and potential research directions. Contents: List of Notation; Chapter 1: What is Convex Algebraic Geometry?; Chapter 2: Semidefinite Optimization; Chapter 3: Polynomial Optimization, Sums of Squares, and Applications; Chapter 4: Nonnegative Polynomials and Sums of Squares; Chapter 5: Dualities; Chapter 6: Semidefinite Representability; Chapter 7: Convex Hulls of Algebraic Sets; Chapter 8: Free Convexity; Chapter 9: Sums of Hermitian Squares: Old and New; Appendix A: Background Material.}

A successive parallel research line inside the automated reasoning community investigated uniform quantifier-free interpolants (sometimes referred to as ``covers'') in first-order theories. In this paper, we investigate cover transfer to theory combinations in the disjoint signatures case. We prove that, for convex theories, cover algorithms can be transferred to theory combinations under the same hypothesis needed to transfer quantifier-free interpolation (i.e., the equality interpolating property, aka strong amalgamation property). The key feature of our algorithm relies on the extensive usage of the Beth definability property for primitive fragments to convert implicitly defined variables into their explicitly defining terms. In the non-convex case, we show by a counterexample that cover may not exist in the combined theories, even in case combined quantifier-free interpolants do exist.",

If the length of the set H of Horn clauses (viewed as the string obtained by concatenating the clauses in H) is n, it is possible to design an algorithm running in time O(n log(n)). These algorithms are obtained by generalising the concept of congruence closure to ground Horn clauses. The basic idea behind these algorithms is that the congruence closure induced by a set of ground Horn clauses can be obtained by interleaving steps in which an equational congruence closure is computed, and steps in which an implicational type of closure is computed."

If the Horn formula A contains K distinct propositional letters and if it is assumed that they are exactly P1,…, PK, the two algorithms presented in this paper run in time O(N), where N is the total number of occurrences of literals in A. By representing a Horn proposition as a graph, the satisfiability problem can be formulated as a data flow problem, a certain type of pebbling. The difference between the two algorithms presented here is the strategy used for pebbling the graph. The first algorithm is based on the principle used for finding the set of nonterminals of a context-free grammar from which the empty string can be derived. The second algorithm is a graph traversal and uses a “call-by-need” strategy. This algorithm uses an attribute grammar to translate a propositional Horn formula to its corresponding graph in linear time. Our formulation of the satisfiability problem as a data flow problem appears to be new and suggests the possibility of improving efficiency using parallel processors."

Using interpolant-generation procedures for individual theories as black-boxes, our method modularly generates interpolants for the combined theory. Our combination method applies for a broad class of first-order theories, which we characterize as equality-interpolating Nelson-Oppen theories. This class includes many useful theories such as the quantifier-free theories of uninterpreted functions, linear inequalities over reals, and Lisp structures. The combination method can be implemented within existing Nelson-Oppen-style decision procedures (such as Simplify, Verifun, ICS, CVC-Lite, and Zap).",

  abstract = {Interpolating provers have a number of applications in formal verification, including abstraction refinement and invariant generation. It has proved difficult, however, to construct efficient interpolating provers for rich theories. We consider the problem of deriving interpolants from proofs generated by the highly efficient SMT solver Z3 in the quantified theory of arrays, uninterpreted function symbols and linear integer arithmetic (AUFLIA) a theory that is commonly used in program verification. We do not directly interpolate the proofs from Z3. Rather, we divide them into small lemmas that can be handled by a secondary interpolating prover for a restricted theory. We show experimentally that the overhead of this secondary prover is negligible.  Moreover, the efficiency of Z3 makes it possible to handle problems that are beyond the reach of existing interpolating provers, as we demonstrate using benchmarks derived from bounded verification of sequential and concurrent programs.},

It provides a natural and effective means for computing separation between the sets of `good' and `bad' states. The existing algorithms for interpolant generation are proof-based: They require explicit construction of proofs, from which interpolants can be computed. Construction of such proofs is a difficult task. We propose an algorithm for the generation of interpolants for the combined theory of linear arithmetic and uninterpreted function symbols that does not require a priori constructed proofs to derive interpolants. It uses a reduction of the problem to constraint solving in linear arithmetic, which allows application of existing highly optimized Linear Programming solvers in black-box fashion. We provide experimental evidence of the practical applicability of our algorithm.",

The CPU time needed for verification is independent of the data path width, the register file size, and the number of ALU operations. Debugging information is automatically produced for incorrect processor designs. Much of the power of the method results from an efficient validity checker for a logic of uninterpreted functions with equality. Empirical results include the verification of a pipelined implementation of a subset of the DLX architecture.",

  abstract="Given a theory {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}T{\}}{\$}and two formulas A and B jointly unsatisfiable in {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}T{\}}{\$}, a theory interpolant of A and B is a formula I such that (i) its non-theory symbols are shared by A and B, (ii) it is entailed by A in {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}T{\}}{\$}, and (iii) it is unsatisfiable with B in {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}T{\}}{\$}. Theory interpolants are used in model checking to accelerate the computation of reachability relations. We present a novel method for computing ground interpolants for ground formulas in the theory of equality. Our algorithm computes interpolants from colored congruence graphs representing derivations in the theory of equality. These graphs can be produced by conventional congruence closure algorithms in a straightforward manner. By working with graphs, rather than at the level of individual proof steps, we are able to derive interpolants that are pleasingly simple (conjunctions of Horn clauses) and smaller than those generated by other tools.",

  abstract="Craig's interpolation theorem has numerous applications in model checking, automated reasoning, and synthesis. There is a variety of interpolation systems which derive interpolants from refutation proofs; these systems are ad-hoc and rigid in the sense that they provide exactly one interpolant for a given proof. In previous work, we introduced a parametrised interpolation system which subsumes existing interpolation methods for propositional resolution proofs and enables the systematic variation of the logical strength and the elimination of non-essential variables in interpolants. In this paper, we generalise this system to propositional hyper-resolution proofs and discuss its application to proofs generated by contemporary SAT solvers. Finally, we show that, when applied to local (or split) proofs, our extension generalises two existing interpolation systems for first-order logic and relates them in logical strength.",

  abstract="The problem of computing Craig interpolants in SMT has recently received a lot of interest, mainly for its applications in formal verification. Efficient algorithms for interpolant generation have been presented for some theories of interest --including that of equality and uninterpreted functions ({\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}EUF{\}}{\$}), linear arithmetic over the rationals ({\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}LA{\}}({\backslash}mathbb{\{}Q{\}}){\$}), and some fragments of linear arithmetic over the integers ({\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}LA{\}}({\backslash}mathbb{\{}Z{\}}){\$})-- and they are successfully used within model checking tools.",

  abstract="Interpolation means finding intermediate formulae between given formulae. When formulae decorate program locations, and describe sets of program states, interpolation may enable a program analyzer to discover information about intermediate locations and states. This mechanism has an increasing number of applications, that are relevant to program analysis and synthesis. We study interpolation in theorem proving decision procedures based on the DPLL({\$}{\{}{\backslash}cal T{\}}{\$}) paradigm. We survey interpolation systems for DPLL, equality sharing and DPLL({\$}{\{}{\backslash}cal T{\}}{\$}), reconstructing from the literature their completeness proofs, and clarifying the requirements for interpolation in the presence of equality.",
